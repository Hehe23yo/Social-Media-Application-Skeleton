# Social Media Application

This is a Java project of replicating a skeleton of a social media application, with the ability to <ins> create posts </ins> and <ins> add comments <>/ins> to individual posts, all <ins> mapped to individual multiple users </ins>.

This project was made using ** j2ee and h2 database **.

This endeavour was a part of my final project under the training held in my University and helped me ponder hard on the architecture and flow of requests all around the application.
