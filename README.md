#Social Media Application

This is a Java project of replicating a skeleton of a social media application, with the ability to create posts and add comments to individual posts, all mapped to individual multiple users.
This project was made using j2ee and h2 database.
This endeavour was a part of my final project under the training held in my University and helped me ponder hard on the architecture and flow of requests all around the application.
